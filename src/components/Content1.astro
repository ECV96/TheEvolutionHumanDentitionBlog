    <p class="mb-5">
        In recent years, many dental problems affect daily life. One reason is the
        modern diet because the foods are sweeter, more processed, and softer, so
        people chew less, especially during growth. With lower masticatory load,
        dental arches can develop narrower and there is less space for the back
        teeth. Figure 2 from Silvester et al. (2021) shows how industrial samples
        have a different wear pattern compared with pre-industrial groups,
        consistent with changed chewing behavior. A second result of the same shift
        appears in Figure 2 from Adler et al. (2013): ancient dental calculus and
        modern plaque form separate clusters, meaning the oral microbiota moved
        toward a more cariogenic profile as starch and sugar increased. Together,
        these figures explain how dietary change across generations shaped human
        dentition smaller arches and limited posterior space related to third
        molars, and a higher caries risk due to a more cariogenic biofilm (Silvester
        et al. 2021; Adler et al. 2013).
