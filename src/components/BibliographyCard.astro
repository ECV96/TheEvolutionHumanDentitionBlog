                In this paper, researchers study ancient dental calculus to
                examine how changes in human dietary habits affected the
                composition of mouth bacteria. They compare hunter-gatherers,
                early farmers, and industrial people. During the Industrial
                Revolution, cariogenic bacteria became dominant. Apparently, as
                the diet contains more starch and sugar, the oral microbiota
                shifts to a more cariogenic profile.
            </p>

            <p>
                I use Figure 2 to show how different lifestyles are associated
                with different mouth bacteria at different times. Ancient
                calculus from hunter-gatherer and early farming groups is very
                different compared with modern plaque. When the diet started to
                added more sugar, people tend to developed more dental problems.
                That is one reason caries has increased in recent times. I think
                it's a good idea to use this article as a starting point to
                discuss a common dental issue: dental plaque. Then I will link
                it to my main topic (third molars): the same diet shift that
                changed the biofilm also reduced chewing demand, which is part
                of why many modern jaws are smaller and leave less space for M3.

                This article explains how the modern diet, rich in soft foods,
                and certain oral habits, such as chewing food less thoroughly,
                can affect jaw development and dental occlusion. Chewing less
                during childhood can lead to smaller dental arches, resulting in
                less space for the teeth. The post-industrial diet also had
                negative effects, as foods became increasingly processed and
                standardized, containing more and more sugar, thus contributing
                to the emergence of new dental problems seen today. The article
                supports the idea that changes in food texture (and eating
                frequency/snacking habits) contribute to the increased
                prevalence of crowded teeth and problems with wisdom teeth in
                current patients.

                I plan to use this paper as an introduction to the topic I will
                focus on: how, at the beginning of the industrial era, numerous
                dental problems began to emerge, from tooth decay to changes in
                jaw structure due to alterations in food texture and the
                resulting changes in chewing habits.

                This article analyzes the relationship between the absence of
                third molars (M3) and smaller jaw and facial dimensions. Using
                geometric morphometric, the authors compare patients with and
                without agenesis of the third molars. The results showed that
                when one or more third molars are missing, the maxilla and
                mandible are smaller, and the facial structure is also smaller;
                this effect intensifies as the number of missing third molars
                increases. The cranial base does not show this effect.
                Furthermore, this association is observed even when the agenesis
                affects only one dental arch. Therefore, it is concluded that
                the agenesis (absence) of third molars is related to smaller
                jaws and less space.
            </p>

            <p>
                For my project, I will use Table 3 from the article, which shows
                the differences in the size of the maxilla, mandible, and face
                in men and women with and without third molars. This table will
                be very useful for explaining why many patients today have
                insufficient posterior space and problems with the eruption of
                their third molars.

                This article discusses the frequency of missing third molars
                (M3) and its relationship with the absence of other teeth. The
                authors compare two groups: (1) individuals with agenesis of
                some teeth (excluding M3s) and (2) individuals without dental
                agenesis. The results show that M3 agenesis is common and more
                frequent in the group with other dental anomalies. Differences
                according to sex and jaw (upper and lower) are also analyzed.

                I will use the graph found in the article because it compares
                two groups: people with agenesis of other teeth and a control
                group. It shows how many third molars are missing (from 0 to 4)
                in each person. In the group with agenesis, the absence of all
                four third molars is more common, while in the control group,
                the absence of third molars is less frequent.

                This article analyzes numerous panoramic radiographs of young
                adults, focusing on impacted lower third molars. It describes
                the most common angulations (mesioangular impaction is very
                frequent) and how these characteristics vary with age. As people
                age, vertical impaction becomes more common, the retromolar
                space tends to increase, and root formation continues.

                of 20, the root continues to grow, which can make extraction
                more difficult.
